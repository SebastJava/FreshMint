Please don't use any "logo-FONT-src-*.svg" fileÂ !
You should prefer the "logo-FONT-*.svg" versions.

"src" = "source". These "src" files are created using fonts. Those fonts are not available on all systems! Some fonts are only part of the Linux Mint distribution, and some others were downloaded from https://fonts.google.com/

All the "logo-FONT-*.svg" got converted into paths. No fonts are being used, so it should work on all systems. And they were saved as plain SVG, to keep files as small as possible.

All those files got created on Inkscape, on Linux Mint, by SebastJava.
