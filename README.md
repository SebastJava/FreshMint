## FreshMint

A new theme for the Linux Mint Forums!  
Not just screenshots... Not just a showcase...  

Start using this new theme today and improve your user experience!  

It works on Firefox and Chrome.  
It works on your computer.  
It works on Android too.  

And it would work on all browsers and all systems if the Linux Mint team chose to install this FreshMint on their servers...

## Everything got redesigned

The page header is the first thing people will see and thus it is very important. Extra care was taken on this page header. But there is much more than this here. Everything was looked at and readjusted.

* a communicative design
* sufficient contrasts
* colors that echo the main website

And then the extra coding was reduced to very little. So it shouldn't pose too much trouble when the time comes to update the phpBB engine.

## Installation

#### Userstyle manager

First, you need a userstyle manager that supports installing UserCSS.

* Stylus for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) (recommended).

#### UserCSS file

Next, open [FreshMint.user.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastJava/FreshMint/main/FreshMint.user.css) or [FreshMint-dark.user.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastJava/FreshMint/main/FreshMint-dark.user.css) here in your web browser.

Stylus will then open a new tab showing some basic information & options:

* Click on the "Install style" button.
* Click on the "Check for updates" checkbox.

Once installed, you will be redirected to Stylus editor page with the newly installed/updated UserCSS loaded. Close this if you don't want or need to modify the style.

**Now you can see and feel your new [Linux Mint Forums](https://forums.linuxmint.com)!**

#### A better start (optional)

The default board style on the forums is **Minty**. That's a fork from the standard **Prosilver** style. This **FreshMint** here is build directly on top of that **Prosilver** source.

**If you are in a hurry, don't worry and just skip this step.** All the `colors.css` got duplicated, so this FreshMint should look the same on both Minty and Prosilver. But if you want to make sure everything is 100% accurate, please switch to Prosilver.

#### Color gradient

This color gradient has the exact same colors as those found on the main website. We all agree there should be some consistency all across the different Linux Mint websites. But the page-header here on FreshMint is much smaller than the one on the [main website](https://linuxmint.com/). So, i find it works better here with a 90Â° angle and different starting and ending points: `linear-gradient(90deg, #69B53F 33%, #2AB9A5 67%)`.

Anyway, i turned this into a text variable, so you can quickly try anything you want. [Experiment with colors and styles!](https://github.com/SebastJava/FreshMint?tab=readme-ov-file#experiment-with-colors-and-styles)

#### References

> A contrast ratio of 3:1 is the minimum level recommended by [ISO-9241-3] and [ANSI-HFES-100-1988] for standard text and vision. The 4.5:1 ratio is used in this provision to account for the loss in contrast that results from moderately low visual acuity, congenital or acquired color deficiencies, or the loss of contrast sensitivity that typically accompanies aging.

## Forum signatures

There are also new signatures for members of the Linux Mint community. A signature is a signature. The style should stand out a little: [LM-forums-signatures](https://github.com/SebastJava/LM-forums-signatures)

## Troubleshooting

* **Flashing of unstyled content (FOUC):** To avoid this, click on the Stylus Options (or gear icon). In the "Advanced" section, turn on the "Instant inject mode".

**If you find a bug or have an issue,** please open a new [issue](https://github.com/SebastJava/FreshMint/issues).
