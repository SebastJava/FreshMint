## Installation

#### Userstyle manager

First, you need a userstyle manager that supports installing UserCSS.

* Stylus for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) (recommended).
* xStyle for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/xstyle/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xstyle/hncgkmhphmncjohllpoleelnibpmccpj).

#### UserCSS file

Open [FreshMint.user.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastJava/FreshMint/main/FreshMint.user.css) here in your web browser.

Stylus will open a new tab showing some basic information & options:

* Click on the "Install style" button.
* Click on the "Check for updates" checkbox.

Once installed, you will be redirected to Stylus' editor page with the newly installed/updated UserCSS loaded. Close this if you don't want or need to modify the style.

Now you can see and feel your new https://forums.linuxmint.com

## Troubleshooting

* **Flashing of unstyled content (FOUC):** To avoid this, click on the Stylus Options (gear icon). In the "Advanced" section, turn on the "Instant inject mode".
